title: Accelerating Development with Serverless Architecture
duration: May 2024 to July 2024
---

Serverless architecture, often referred to as Function as a Service (FaaS), abstracts server management and infrastructure provisioning, allowing developers to focus solely on writing and deploying code in the form of stateless functions. Key features of serverless architecture include:

-   **Event-Driven Model**: Functions are triggered by events or HTTP requests, scaling dynamically based on demand.
-   **Pay-Per-Use Billing**: Billing is based on the actual execution time and resources consumed by functions, offering cost savings compared to traditional server-based models.
-   **Auto-Scaling**: Serverless platforms automatically scale resources up or down based on workload flu
